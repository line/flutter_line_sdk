## 2.3.0

### Added

* Add support for building as static library in the hosting project. By default Flutter uses plugins as framework on iOS, but you are now also free to remove `use_framework!` in Flutter's Podfile and LINE SDK won't compliant about it anymore. [#62](https://github.com/line/flutter_line_sdk/pull/62)

* Upgrade the `minSdkVersion` for Android platform to 21, which matches the LINE client app on the same platform.

## 1.2.11
